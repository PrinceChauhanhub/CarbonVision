## ðŸŒ³About Carbon Footprint Calculator ProjectðŸŒ³

The global annual carbon footprint has now surpassed an alarming 40 billion tons, underscoring the urgent need for collective action to mitigate climate change. There exists a direct and undeniable correlation between the daily habits of individuals and the surge in CO2 emissions. Everyday practices, ranging from energy consumption and transportation to residential heating-cooling systems and food production-consumption, significantly contribute to this escalating environmental challenge. Recognizing the pivotal role individuals play in this scenario, it becomes imperative to foster awareness regarding their impact on the global increase in CO2 levels. The core objective of the project is to empower individuals by helping them calculate their monthly carbon footprint. By incorporating considerations of daily, weekly, and monthly habits and lifestyle choices, the initiative aims to offer personalized insights. Furthermore, the project is geared towards not only raising awareness but also providing practical recommendations for individuals to actively reduce their carbon footprints. Through these efforts, the goal is to encourage sustainable living practices that contribute to a more environmentally conscious and responsible global community.
